**Note**:
- I have used the tech-stack of Nodejs,ExpressJS, MongoDB, ReactJS for building this website.
- There are 2 pages: Homepage and specific Moviepage in the frontend.
- Data that I have added, is present in the file of data.json in the main directory.
- I have tested the backend api's using POSTMAN:
    * https://moviepage-pathend.onrender.com/api/movies [POST]
    * https://moviepage-pathend.onrender.com/api/movies [GET]
